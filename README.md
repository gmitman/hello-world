# hello-world
A repository to acclimate myself with GitHub

Over the past several years, I have founded a non-profit which raised over $100,000 to renovate a basketball court in Turks and Caicos, coached and mentored a team of immigrant children in basketball during the spring and summer in a paid position at the YMCA after starting as a volunteer, and recently started a small t-shirt business.  While these experiences are not computer science specific, I am mentioning them to highlight that I am not afraid to take on a challenge from the ground floor.
